# Fine-Tuning a Model for Assamese Chat Completion: A 3-Week Plan

## Introduction and Overview
Your goal is to fine-tune a language model for Assamese chat completion using a raw text dataset, with a deadline of 3 weeks. You have the flexibility to train on your laptop, Google Colab, or a GPU server, depending on performance needs. This document provides a comprehensive plan covering data preparation, model selection, training, and evaluation, ensuring you can deliver a functional model on time.

## Choosing the Training Platform
The choice of platform depends on your dataset size, model complexity, and performance requirements. Here’s a breakdown to help you decide:

### Laptop (with GPU):
**Pros:** Full control, no time limits, works offline.  
**Cons:** Limited by your hardware (e.g., GPU memory, processing power).  
**Best for:** Small-to-medium datasets if you have a decent GPU (e.g., 8GB+ VRAM).  

### Google Colab:
**Pros:** Free GPU access (e.g., NVIDIA T4), easy to set up, scalable.  
**Cons:** 12-hour session limits, occasional GPU shortages, requires data uploads.  
**Best for:** Most users, especially if your laptop lacks a strong GPU. Ideal for medium-sized datasets.  

### GPU Server (e.g., AWS, Azure):
**Pros:** High-performance GPUs, no session limits, handles large datasets.  
**Cons:** Costs money, requires setup (e.g., configuring an instance).  
**Best for:** Large datasets or if you need faster training and can afford it.  

**How to Decide:** Start with Google Colab for its cost-performance balance. Monitor performance (e.g., training speed, memory usage) after the first epoch. If sessions disconnect or training is too slow, switch to a GPU server. Use your laptop only if it has a capable GPU and the dataset is small.  

## Data Preparation
Your raw Assamese text dataset needs to be cleaned and formatted before training.

### Step 1: Clean the Data
- Remove irrelevant content (e.g., non-Assamese text, special characters, noise).  
- Ensure UTF-8 encoding to support Assamese script.  
- Use a Python script or text editor for cleaning. Example:

```python
with open("raw.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    lines = [line.strip() for line in f if line.strip() and "valid_assamese_text" in line]
with open("cleaned.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write("\n".join(lines))
```

### Step 2: Split the Data
Divide the cleaned text into:
- `train.txt` (80% for training)
- `val.txt` (20% for validation)

Aim for at least 10,000 high-quality sentences. Example split:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
with open("cleaned.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
train_lines, val_lines = train_test_split(lines, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
with open("train.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write("".join(train_lines))
with open("val.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write("".join(val_lines))
```

Tip: Upload `train.txt` and `val.txt` to Google Drive (for Colab) or your server’s storage to streamline access.

## Model Selection
Selecting an efficient yet capable model is key to meeting your timeline.

### Recommended Model: Mistral-7B
- A lightweight, high-performing model optimized for chat tasks.  
- Works well with Unsloth for efficient fine-tuning on limited hardware.  

### Alternative: LLaMA-7B or a smaller variant supported by Unsloth.

**Why Mistral-7B?** It balances performance and resource needs, making it trainable within 3 weeks on any platform.

## Setting Up the Environment
Set up your chosen platform with the required libraries.

### Install Libraries:
```bash
pip install "unsloth[cu121] @ git+https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth.git"
pip install transformers datasets
```

### Platform-Specific Setup:
**Laptop:**  
Ensure GPU drivers and CUDA are installed. Test GPU access:
```bash
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"  # Should print "True"
```

**Google Colab:**  
Enable GPU runtime: Runtime > Change runtime type > GPU.

Mount Google Drive:
```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

**GPU Server:**  
Launch an instance with a GPU (e.g., NVIDIA T4 or better).
Install dependencies and upload your dataset.

## Fine-Tuning the Model

### Step 1: Load the Model and Tokenizer
```python
from unsloth import FastLanguageModel
import torch

model, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(
    "mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1",
    dtype=torch.float16,
    load_in_4bit=True
)
```

### Step 2: Tokenize the Dataset
```python
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("text", data_files={"train": "train.txt", "validation": "val.txt"})
tokenized_datasets = dataset.map(
    lambda x: tokenizer(x["text"], truncation=True, padding="max_length", max_length=128),
    batched=True
)
```

### Step 3: Configure Training
```python
from unsloth import UnslothTrainer
from transformers import TrainingArguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./mistral_assamese",
    per_device_train_batch_size=2,
    gradient_accumulation_steps=4,
    learning_rate=5e-5,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    fp16=True
)

trainer = UnslothTrainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_datasets["train"],
    eval_dataset=tokenized_datasets["validation"],
    tokenizer=tokenizer
)
```

### Step 4: Train the Model
```python
trainer.train()
```

## Monitoring and Evaluation
Monitor training loss and validation loss to prevent overfitting. Test with an Assamese prompt:

```python
input_text = "আজি মোৰ দিনটো"
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=50)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

## Timeline and Milestones
**Week 1: Data Prep and Setup**  
- Days 1-2: Clean and split the dataset.  
- Day 3: Set up the environment.  
- Days 4-5: Tokenize data and load the model.  

**Week 2: Fine-Tuning**  
- Days 6-10: Train the model (3 epochs).  

**Week 3: Evaluation and Wrap-Up**  
- Days 11-12: Evaluate and tweak the model.  
- Day 13: Save and test the final model.  

## Conclusion
Follow this structured plan to fine-tune an Assamese chat model within 3 weeks. Start now and adjust based on platform constraints. Good luck!
