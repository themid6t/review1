- Add a simple, aesthetic background image (Assamese culture/tech AI fusion).
## Slide 2: Introduction (Spoken by Tabarakul)
#### Content:
- NativeGPT ‚Äì What is it?
    - A chatbot designed to understand and generate Assamese text using Mistral-7B with QLoRA fine-tuning.
- Why are we building it?
    - Lack of AI tools for Assamese ‚Üí Google & OpenAI have minimal support.
    - Assamese is spoken by 30M+ people ‚Üí Needs better AI accessibility.
    - Goal: Help students, researchers, and general users interact with AI in Assamese.
- Visuals:
    - A simple graphic showing AI models (GPT, Gemini) vs. NativeGPT for Assamese.

## Slide 3: Problem Statement (Spoken by Uday)
#### Content:
- Current Challenges:
    - Assamese lacks high-quality NLP datasets ‚Üí Hard to train AI.
    - Existing models (GPT, Gemini) struggle with Assamese grammar & dialects.
    - Low-resource AI training ‚Üí Need for optimization on limited hardware.
- Our Solution:
    - Create an AI specifically trained for Assamese conversation.
    - Fine-tune an open-source LLM (Mistral-7B) with custom datasets.
    - Optimize for low-GPU hardware (QLoRA technique).
- Visuals:
    - A contrast table: Existing AI (Poor Assamese Support) vs. NativeGPT (Fluent & Accurate).
## Slide 4: Project Objectives (Spoken by Uday)
#### Content:
- Key Goals of NativeGPT:
    - ‚úÖ Develop an Assamese language chatbot using Mistral-7B
    - ‚úÖ Use QLoRA fine-tuning to optimize for low-GPU devices
    - ‚úÖ Collect & preprocess high-quality Assamese text data
    - ‚úÖ Build a frontend chat UI for easy interaction
    - ‚úÖ Overcome data scarcity & hardware limitations

## Slide 6: Dataset Collection & Preprocessing (Spoken by Changrung)
#### Content:
- Sources of Data:
    - Assamese books, articles, Wikipedia, government documents.
    - Scraped social media posts & news reports (cleaned & filtered).
- Data Preprocessing Steps:
    - Tokenization (breaking text into words)
    - Filtering noise (removing duplicate or irrelevant text)
    - Creating prompts & responses for chatbot training
- Visuals:
    - A before-after table (Raw text vs. Cleaned text).
## Slide 7: Model Selection & Training Setup (Spoken by Changrung)
#### Content:
- Why Mistral-7B?
    - Lightweight yet powerful, open-source, efficient for low-GPU devices.
- Training Setup:
    - QLoRA fine-tuning ‚Üí Uses low VRAM (4GB GPU optimization).
    - Training on our dataset (custom Assamese text).
- Visuals:
    - A comparison of Mistral-7B vs. GPT-3.5 (Assamese performance).
## Slide 8: Training Challenges & Solutions (Spoken by Rishikesh)
#### Content:
- Challenges Faced:
    - üö® Limited GPU resources (NVIDIA 1650, 4GB VRAM).
    - üö® Lack of clean Assamese datasets ‚Üí Manual curation needed.
    - üö® Training time is high ‚Üí Needed efficiency tricks.
- Solutions Implemented:
    - ‚úÖ QLoRA compression ‚Üí 4x less VRAM usage.
    - ‚úÖ Using Google Colab Pro for training.
    - ‚úÖ Dataset filtering & augmentation for better quality.
- Visuals:
    - Screenshot of training logs & GPU utilization.
## Slide 9: Current Progress & Chat Interface (Spoken by Tabarakul)
